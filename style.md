# Style Guide

## Naming Conventions

1. use snake_case not camelCase for variable and function names
1. variables should be lowercase
1. upper case are used for constants `PI = 3.14`
1. UpperCamelCase for class names
1. `__private__`  double underscore is convention that means you are not supposed access this variable directly. They are by convention like private variables in other languages.
