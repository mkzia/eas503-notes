    "## General Machine Learning Concept\n",
    "- Simplified: in machine learning, a computer is trained to classify new data. Think of it as an input-output device that takes in a number of inputs, and based on the pattern of these inputs, determine the most likely class associated with that data. There two main types of learning strategies. 1) Supervised learning where you train the machine using data for which the correct class is known. 2) Unsupervised learning where the classifier itself tries to find patterns within the input data itself. (Biosignal and Medical Image Processing John Semmlow) \n",
    "- Classification (determine `label`) vs Regression (predict a `numerical value`) \n",

    "### Loading data\n",

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean and Variance\n",
    "- algorithms require that all the features have variance of similar magnitude. If the magnitude differ by orders of magnitude larger than others, it might dominate the objective function.\n",
    "  - Whatever mean or std you subtract from the training set, you have to use the same on the testing set. \n",
    "- Algorithms assume that the input data is Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. \n",
    "- Power transformers aim to map data from any distribution to as close to a Gaussian distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding\n",
    "- Map text values to integer codes. For example, instead of using text for city names, use integers, or Male = 0, Female = 1. This allows fitting numerical values into models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discretization \n",
    "- Turn continuous values in to discrete values. You bin the continuous into bins. *** Linear models can become non-linear due to discretization \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imputation \n",
    "- Many real world datasets contain missing values; \n",
    "  - Discard entire rows\n",
    "  - Or fill data -- usually by guessing from available data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting Data\n",
    "- It is common to split data into training and testing samples. \n",
    "- Usually you do 90/10 or 80/20. \n",
    "- The splitting has to be random\n",
    "- K-Cross-fold validation -- split data K times\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "- LR models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variable. When one increase or decrease, the other increases or decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "- Simple supervised machine learning classifier\n",
    "- Assumes the features are independent \n",
    "  - Example -- apple is red, round and 4 cm in diameter \n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "- Another supervised machine learning classifier\n",
    "  - use for both classification and regression \n",
    "- Can do non-linear classification\n",
