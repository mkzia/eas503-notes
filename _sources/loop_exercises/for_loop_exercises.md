# For Loop Exercises

## Exercise 1
Write a function that takes in a list of values and returns its sum

## Exercise 2
Write a function that takes in a list of values and returns its average

## Exercise 3
Write a function that takes in a list of values and returns its average.
Instead of using a for loop as in ex2, use sum() and len() to calculate the average

## Exercise 4
Write a function that multiplies the elements of the list by two and returns them

## Exercise 5
Write a pow() function that computes the power of each element in a list

## Exercise 6
Write a function to remove duplicate from a list

## Exercise 7
Write a function that reads grades from an input file and calculates their average
- input: filename
- use: for_ex7_data1.txt
- use: for_ex7_data2.txt
- use: for_ex7_data3.txt
- Use a list to read the values in to and then use sum and len to calculate the average.
- Be careful about empty rows!
- Be careful about non-numbers!

## Exercise 8
Write a function simulates a coin toss
- Input: number of simulation
- Output: a string that concatenates the results, ex. 'HHHTTTHTHTHT'


## Exercise 9
Write a function that uses the output from the 
coin_toss function and calculates the probability of H and T
Input: number of simulation
Output: probability of H and T

## Exercise 10
Write a function that simulates coin_toss_probability for a given number of times and calculates the average of H and T
Input: number of simulations
Input: number of coin tosses
Output: average probability


## Exercise 11
Write a function that reads a file in which each line has multiple student
grades and calculates the student average grade
Print average of each student on screen
Use list comprehension to convert grades to int
use: for_ex11_data.txt
