## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the
honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university while facilitating the university’s imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the
generation of new and innovative ideas. The UB graduate academic integrity policy is available
at https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity.

The sharing or posting of material related to EAS 503, and requests for help or answers on
any electronic tool, such as Chegg, Stack Overflow, and Course Hero, is considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Consequences of violating the academic integrity policy may range from zero
points to expulsion from the university, depending on the seriousness of the violation.

The following are the academic integrity policies for this course:
1. If multiple students submit the same homework solution then the involved parties will
earn zero points for the common solution(s).
2. If we can positively identify a student who has uploaded material to any online resource,
that student will earn an automatic failure in the course.
3. All students who are positively identified as viewing the solution for any length of time
will receive a score of zero for the problem(s) viewed.
All Academic Integrity violations will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Multiple violations of the Academic Integrity policy will result in an escalation of the imposed
sanction.

Follow good cyber-security practices. Do not provide physical or electronic access
to your computer or accounts! If another student gains or is provided access to
your computer or on-line account and they violate the Academic Integrity Policy,
you will be held responsible!

### Example 1
Student A has been positively identified as posting a homework question to Chegg, Stack Overflow, Course Hero.
That student will earn an “F” in the course and be reported to the University.

### Example 2
Students B and C are working on code for a homework together. Student B finished
the code but Student C is stuck and does not know how to proceed. Student B let’s Student C
look (either in person or electronically) at their code, which Student C then uses to complete
the problem. Both Student B and Student C will earn a zero on the entire homework and be
reported to the University.

### Example 3
Students D and E are working on code for a homework together. Student D finished
the code but Student E is stuck and does not know how to proceed. Students D and E verbally
discuss the code but do not view each other’s code and Student D does not tell the code that
Student E needs. During this Student E learns what was done wrong and how to fix it. This is
not a violation of academic integrity and thus no sanction will apply.

### Example 4
Student F’s computer is non-functional and student G allows student F access to
their laptop to finish a homework. While doing so student F copies code that student G has
already completed. Both students will earn a zero on the entire homework or exam and will be
reported to the University.

By submitting work for a grade, students are accepting the academic integrity
policy.
