    "## Previous Lecture\n",
    "- In the previous lecture we covered functions.\n",
    "  - Functions are small, self-contained set of instructions that can be called at anytime.\n",
    "- We covered how to use built-in functions.\n",
    "- We covered how to write your own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Strings Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, text is represented as a string, which is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, and symbols).\n",
    "- In Python, we indicate that a value is a string by putting either single or double quotes around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Strings\n",
    "- `len()` -- to get length of a string\n",
    "- `+` -- can add strings, but not str and type float or int\n",
    "- `*` -- to repeat a string \n",
    "- `+=` -- add to another string and save value\n",
    "- `int(3)`\n",
    "- `float(3.4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Quotes vs Double Quotes\n",
    "-\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Aristotle'\n",
    "\"Issac Newton\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Triple Quotes for String Literal\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''Should you want a string\n",

    "​ \tUse matched triple quotes.'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a string literal. \n",
    "        Spaces are printed as is. \n",
    "  Hello there!\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining the length of a string\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scientist = 'Issac Newton'\n",
    "print(len(scientist))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concatenating Strings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Alan Turning' + ' ' + 'Grace Hopper'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'NH' + 3 # This will not work. You cannot add a str and int type. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Four score and ' + str(7) + ' years ago'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting Strings to Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "int('0')\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeating Strings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'AT' * 5\n",
    "'-' * 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Special Characters in Strings\n",
    "- How would you put a single quote inside a string that is declared using a single quote?\n",
    "- `'\\\\'` -- how would you print `/\\/\\`\n",
    "- `'\\n'`\n",
    "- `'\\''`\n",
    "- `'\\\"'`\n",
    "- `'\\t'` -- useful for parsing TSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing in Python\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('abbcd', 2, 3)\n",

    "    print('The temperature in celsius is: ', celsius) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## String Formatting\n",
    "- The fastest and latest way to do string formatting is using the F-strings (https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)\n",
    "- ``` python\n",
    "  PI = 3.14159265359 \n",
    "  print(f'{PI:.2f}')\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  PI = 3.14159265359 \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- Python uses type str to represent text as sequences of characters.\n",
    "- Strings are created by placing pairs of single quotes `’` or double quotes `\"` around the text.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''Should you want a string\n",
    "    ​ \tthat crosses multiple lines,\n",
    "    ​ \tUse matched triple quotes.'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Special characters like newline (\\n) and tab (\\t) are represented using escape sequences that begin with a backslash. For example, `\"this string\\nspans\\nthree lines\"`.\n",
    "- Values can be printed using built-in function print, and input can be provided by the user using built-in function input. \n",
    "- Methods are like functions, except that the first argument must be an object of the class in which the method is defined."
