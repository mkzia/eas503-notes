    "- Programs are made up of statements, or instructions. These can be simple expressions like 3 + 4 and assignment statements like celsius = 20 (which create new variables or change the values of existing ones). There are many other kinds of statements in Python, and we’ll introduce them throughout the book.\n",
    "- Every value in Python has a specific type, which determines what operations can be applied to it. The two types used to represent numbers are int and float. Floating-point numbers are approximations to real numbers.\n",
    "- Python evaluates an expression by applying higher-precedence operators before lower-precedence operators. You can change that order by putting parentheses around subexpressions.\n",
    "- Python stores every value in computer memory. A memory location containing a value is called an object.\n",
    "- Variables are created by executing assignment statements. If a variable already exists because of a previous assignment statement, Python will use that one instead of creating a new one.\n",
    "- Variables contain memory addresses of values. We say that variables refer to values.\n",
    "- Variables must be assigned values before they can be used in expressions."
