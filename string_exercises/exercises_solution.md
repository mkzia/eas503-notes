# String Exercises Solution

## Exercise 1
Write a Python function that prints the following:

```
They'll hibernate during the winter.
```

```python
def string_ex1():
    print('They\'ll hibernate during the winter.')
    print("They'll hibernate during the winter.")
```

## Exercise 2
Write a Python function that prints the following:

```
"Absolutely not," he said.
```

```python
def string_ex2():
    print('"Absolutely not," he said.')
    print("\"Absolutely not,\" he said.")
```


## Exercise 3
Write a Python function that prints the following:

```
"He said, 'Absolutely not,'" recalled Mel.
```

```python
def string_ex3():
print("\"He said, 'Absolutely not,'\" recalled Mel.")
```
## Exercise 4
Write a Python function that prints the following: 

```
left\right.
```

```python
def string_ex4():
    print("left\\right")
```

## Exercise 5
Write a Python function that prints the following given x = 3:

```
The rabbit is 3.
```

```python
def string_ex5():
    x = 3
    print(f"The rabbit is {x}.")
```

## Exercise 6
# Given x = 3 and y = 12.5 print: The rabbit is 3 years old.
Write a Python function that prints the following given x = 3:

```
The rabbit is 3 years old.
```

```python
def string_ex6():
    x = 3
    print(f"The rabbit is {x} years old.")
```



## Exercise 7
Write a Python function that prints the following given x = 3 and y = 12.5:

```
12.5 * 3.
```

```python
def string_ex7(:)
    x = 3
    y = 12.5

    print(f"{x} * {y}.")
```

## Exercise 8
Write a Python function that prints the following given x = 3 and y = 12.5:

```
12.5 * 3 = 37.5
```

```python
def string_ex8():
    x = 3
    y = 12.5
    print(f"{x} * {y} = {x*y}.")
```

## Exercise 9
Write a Python function that prints the following given y = 12.5:


```
The average is 12.5.
```

```python
def string_ex9():
    y = 12.5
    print(f"The average is {y}.")
```
